# Implementation Plan: SolidState Studio MVP

## Goal Description
Create a full-stack monorepo for SolidState Studio, a web-based physics lab MVP.
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Three.js (R3F), TanStack Query, shadcn/ui.
- **Backend**: Julia (HTTP.jl, JSON3.jl), scientific computing packages.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, docker-compose.
- **Features**: Crystal Builder, Ewald Sphere / Diffractometer, Tight-Binding Bands.

## User Review Required
None immediately (project initialization).

## Proposed Changes

### Structure
- `apps/web`: Frontend application.
- `apps/api`: Backend application.
- `packages/shared`: Shared types and constants.
- `packages/presets`: JSON data for lattices/materials.
- `infra`: Docker configuration.
- `docs`: API contracts and documentation.

### Backend (Julia)
- `Server.jl`: HTTP server setup.
- `Routes.jl`: Route handling.
- `Cache.jl`: In-memory LRU caching.
- `Physics/`: Domain logic for crystals, diffraction, and band structure.

### Frontend (React)
- `App.tsx`: Main entry point and routing.
- `api/`: API client with Zod validation.
- `three/`: Reusable 3D components.
- `scenes/`: Page layouts for labs.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Julia unit tests for physics calculations.
- Smoke tests for API endpoints.

### Manual Verification
- Verify Docker containers start correctly.
- Test endpoint responses with `curl` or Postman.
- Verify 3D rendering and interactivity in browser.
