# SolidState Studio (MVP)

A full-stack web application for Solid State Physics education/exploration.
Includes Crystal Builder, Ewald Diffraction simulator, and Tight-Binding Band Structure calculator.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js (React Three Fiber), Plotly.
- **Backend**: Julia (HTTP.jl), LinearAlgebra, StaticArrays.
- **Infra**: Docker, Docker Compose.

## Structure
- `apps/web`: Frontend source.
- `apps/api`: Backend Julia source.
- `packages/shared`: Shared schemas/constants.
- `packages/presets`: Data presets.
- `infra/docker`: Docker configuration.

## How to Run (Docker) - Recommended

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
2. From the root directory:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:5173 in browser.

## How to Run (Manual/Local)

Requires **Julia >= 1.10** and **Node.js >= 20**.

### 1. Backend
```powershell
cd apps/api
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate();'
julia --project=. src/run.jl
```
Server will start on `0.0.0.0:8080`.

### 2. Frontend
Open a new terminal.
```powershell
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```
Access at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Labs
- **/crystal**: Visualize crystal structures (SC, BCC, FCC, Hex), Planes, and Reciprocal Lattice.
- **/ewald**: Interactive diffraction geometric condition (Ewald sphere).
- **/tb**: Tight-binding band structure and DOS for 1D/2D systems (Graphene, etc.).

## Troubleshooting
- If "Module not found" for `@shared`, ensure `npm install` was run in `apps/web`.
- If Julia fails to precompile, ensure you are on Julia 1.10+.
- If Ewald shows no spots, try adjusting Wavelength or checking "Show Reciprocal Points" in Crystal lab to verify orientation.
